Contributors: Mason Childers, Kristian Feed, Michael Maddison, Nikhil Pande

PulseLink is a wearable device that allows individuals to locate friends in crowded environments such as festivals, fraternity houses, and partites. Our prototype utilizes the Arduino LED board to show the locations of other connected PulseLink devices, as well as their relative elevation.
